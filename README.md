# EDEE
This repository contains an application designed to provide design recommendations for human habitable enclosures that have an opitimized footprint for keeping the inside temperature close to the human comfort range.

Given a set of environment inputs for a specific geographic location, EDEE calculates the optimum design parameters such that the solar energy is stored during the warm/hot season and then released back to the enclosure during the cool/cold season.

## Input:  
Historical temperature, humidity, wind data
Desired floor space

## Output:
Recommended structure dimensions and key design architectural features.
Projected interior seasonal temperature range assuming only solar heat storage is used.  
Projected SMARC index of the structure.
 
## EDEE SMARC INDEX
The design is rated according to the EDEE SMARC index from a scale of 1 to 5 based on the following SMARC parameters:

### Sustainable
The degree to whtochj this structure be sustained on planet earth indefinitely
Examples of a sustainable design are using non polluting recyclable material.

### Maintainable
The degree to which this structure be maintained by its inhabitants.

### Available
The degree to which the materials used are locally availble for building and maintaining the structure.

### Reliable
The degree to which the structure can be relied upon for providing the basic human requirments of Housing, Energy, Agriculture, Transportation needs (HEAT index)

### Convenient
The degree to which this is considered a convenient structure for day to day living of the inhabitants.
