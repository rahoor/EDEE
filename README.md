# EDEE 
This repository contains an application designed to provide design recommendations for human habitable enclosures that have an optimized footprint for keeping the inside temperature close to the human comfort range.
##BASIC ELEMENTS
The basic elements consist of below ground, ground level, above ground, and ventilation.
###Below ground
A labyrinthene acquifer for purifying water and heat equalization from the area above to store in the area below.
The labyrinth is filled with gravel and circulates water similar to an air conditioning or car radiator.  When it is hot, the heat is transferred via the aquifer to the soil.  When it is cold, the stored heat is transferred from the soil to the air inside the enclosure.

###Ground level
The basic living and food growing space consisting of raised bed gardens, a fish pond, labyrinth water recirculation pumb, electrical power storage, and living areas.

###Above ground
Above ground area consists of a spiral perimeter ramp encased between an inner and outer dome with a slope to minimize heat transfer from the interior to the exterior.  IT also consists of an above ground living area at the top of the dome that also serves as additional floor space for mechanical installation and solar installations.  It also contains ventilation cap for controlling temperature during periods of extreme heat absorption exceeding heat storage rate capacity.

###Ventilaiton
Air is allowed to flow through the water washed rock enclosures to temperature regulate interior temperature and exit at the ventilation air exit cap located at the top of the dome.  Mechanical design is implemented in order to prevent use of high technology where ever low technology can achieve the same or better goals.

Given a set of environment inputs for a specific geographic location, EDEE calculates the optimum design parameters such that the solar energy is stored during the warm/hot season and then released back to the enclosure during the cool/cold season.

## Input:  
Historical temperature, humidity, wind data
Desired floor space

## Output:
Recommended structure dimensions and key design architectural features.
Projected interior seasonal temperature range assuming only solar heat storage is used.  
Projected SMARC index of the structure.
 
## EDEE SMARC INDEX
The design is rated according to the EDEE SMARC index from a scale of 1 to 5 based on the following SMARC parameters:

### Sustainable
The degree to which this structure be sustained on planet earth indefinitely
Examples of a sustainable design are using non-polluting recyclable material.

### Maintainable
The degree to which this structure be maintained by its inhabitants.

### Available
The degree to which the materials used are locally availble for building and maintaining the structure.

### Reliable
The degree to which the structure can be relied upon for providing the basic human requirments of Housing, Energy, Agriculture, Transportation needs (HEAT index)

### Convenient
The degree to which this is considered a convenient structure for day to day living of the inhabitants.
